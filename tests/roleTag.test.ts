/**
 * What somebody is at this event is one fact, and it should look like one
 * fact everywhere it appears.
 *
 * It did not. The People list showed the role as a bare `<select>` — four
 * identical grey boxes down the one column an organiser scans to answer "who
 * runs this event" — while the header chip, the merge dialog and the invite
 * page all showed the same fact as a coloured badge. The profile page showed
 * it not at all, so an organiser who opened a profile to check a role had to
 * go back to the row they came from to change it.
 *
 * There is no DOM in this suite, so what is pinned here is the wiring: one
 * colour map, one control, and the three places that must use them.
